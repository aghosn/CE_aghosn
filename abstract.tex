Modern software applications need to process an ever increasing load of data, satisfy exigent service level objectives, while addressing present days concerns about privacy and security.
Applications requirements and architectures became so complex and heterogeneous that no general-purpose monolithic operating system can pretend to fully answer their needs, both in terms of performance and security.
More and more often, developers free themselves from the aging rigid abstractions proposed by the kernel to achieve competitive results.

We believe that the respective roles of the kernel and the application should be re-evaluated to address present days performance and security challenges.
We further argue that those challenges can both be addressed with the same fundamental design principles that tend to establish a clear separation between the kernel and the application.
Such a design would allow application's specific management of physical resources, a greater design flexibility,  and improved performances. 
This design would moreover simplify the implementation of new security models that address Cloud deployment confidentiality and integrity concerns, i.e., a mutual distrust between a host and a guest.

We study three papers that address these challenges and highlight their common design choices:
Haven \cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BaumannPH15} provides shielded execution of Cloud applications, the Exokernel \cite{DBLP:conf/sosp/EnglerKO95} enables application-level management of physical resources, while Unikernels \cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/MadhavapeddyMRSSGSHC13} create specialized standalone secured and high performance appliances for the Cloud.

Finally, understanding the arguments and solutions presented in these papers, we propose our research topic that pertains to kernel design for modern software applications.
