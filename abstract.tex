%Applications evolved but not kernels.
%Cloud deployement, hunt for performance, applications complex that need to handle resources in a particular way (e.g., dataplanes)
%Isolation fine-grained for multi-source applications.
%Kernel abstractions not good enough.
%Question is to explore solution, in hardware, kernel design, and software/pl techniques to redefine roles of each part.

%Should start with goal?

Exponential growth of number of applications, new ways to interact, new ways to distribute them, leads to systems where you execute code coming from various sources.
New ways to execute them as well with cloud services, new challenges for performance.
In the meantime, kernel did not evolve as much in terms of abstractions.
Reevaluating respective roles in order to answer new security challenges and performance requirements.
Let the system become as heterogeneous as the application. 
Want to explore solution based on hardware, kernel design, and software based techniques, such as programming languages features to solve two things:
improve security, while providing more flexibility to the application in terms of resource management.\\

\textit{Try to put something related to specialization, e.g., specialization of physical resource management.}
