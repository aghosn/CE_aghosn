%Haven is a proof of concept.
%Arguments:
%	1. Same as exokernel.
%	2. Applying to exokernel, what could be done?
%	3. unikernels, driver management main issue?
%	4. Haven does not leverage aggressive specialization.

Haven addresses modern confidentiality and integrity concerns that sprung from the growth of Cloud services.
At its heart, Haven relies on the same fundamental design principle as the Exokernel, i.e., it separates policies and mechanisms.
Here, this design choice enables to disentangle the guest from the host, obtain a cleaner separation between mutually distrustful domains, and more easily monitor their interactions.
ADVANTAGES OF EXOKERNEL FOR THIS DESIGN:
1. ALL HARDWARE IS EXPOSED, SO EVEN LESS NEEDS TO RELY ON HOST.
2. LIMITATION is abort protocol.


Mirage and Haven take diametrically opposed approaches: where the former eschews backward compatibility, the latter strives to support backward compatibility.
This design choice, in Haven, was mostly made to test SGX flexibility and limits.
In practice, a solution closer to the unikernel's design presents several advantages and answers some of Haven's limitations.
First, as reported in the evaluation part, dynamic allocation of enclave pages introduces non-negligible overheads.
These overheads can be avoided in Mirage appliances by relying on the existing sealing mechanism for the allocation of memory resources.
Second, 


%with unikernels: perfect!!! Dynamicity of mappings not really supported by SGX.
%Smaller size of appliances, maybe decrease cache pressure?
