\section{Introduction}

%1. Applications evolved
%	1.1. Complicated multi-sourced peace of code.
%	1.2. Requirement for performance and security.
%	1.3. Deployed in new ways (e.g., cloud services)
%	
%2. Operating systems are too rigid.
%	2.1. Abstractions have not evolved much in the past decades.
%	2.2. Resource protection as well as management.
%	2.3. Leave little space for application specific logic.
%	2.4. Built in a way that requires them to be trusted.
%	
%3. Objective
%	3.1. Goals is to study designs that allow
%		3.1.1. separate protection from management.
%		3.1.2. Allow application specific management of resources.
%		3.1.3. Symmetric isolation mechanisms (e.g., protect guest from host).
%		3.1.4. Limit attack surface and rely on verification tools.
%	3.2. For that we study 3 different solutions
%		3.2.1 Hardware mechanism with SGX.
%		3.2.2. Kernel design.
%		3.2.3 Software kernel packaged for an application.
