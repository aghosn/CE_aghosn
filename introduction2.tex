\section{Introduction}

Applications and traditional monolithic operating system designs and abstractions evolved at different paces over the past decades, leading to an important mismatch that impedes both security and performance of modern software.
The advent of the Internet era sparked a technological revolution that lead to the explosion of the number of available software applications.
In an increasingly web-oriented environment, and faced with ever greater volumes of data to process, developers strive to conciliate performance and security.
Unfortunately, popular monolithic operating system expose fixed high-level abstractions, based on standards devised 50 years ago (e.g., POSIX).
These general purpose abstractions impede the flexibility, functionality, and performance of applications.

In an increasingly multi-tasked and web-oriented environment, application developers strive for ever higher network throughputs, finer-grained memory management, fast access to heterogeneous external devices, and strong isolation guarantees.

Meanwhile, the most popular monolithic operating systems are still based on rigid high-level abstractions devised 50 years ago (e.g., POSIX), and fail to take into account the heterogeneity of modern software and hardware setups.
