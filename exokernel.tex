\section{Exokernel: An Operating System Architecture for Application-Level Resource Management}

\subsection{Overview}

\subsection{Application knows best}
Application can manage ressources.
Kernel attack surface is smaller and should be less prone to bugs because it simply safely exposes resources.
Kernel and application responsabilities are better defined.
Crossing from user to kernel can be reduced to a strict minimum.
Avoid all the kernel bypass etc.
Reusability of libraries?\\

Allows for new abstractions closer to application's logic.
How hard would it be to implement lwc in exokernel? Not hard at all.\\

relevant to dataplanes as well.\\

How is scheduling implemented?

\subsection{Evaluation}

Must prove that it improves performance.
Security aspect of it?

\subsection{Discussion}
Main critic is how can you trust libOS?
Drivers reimplementation?
Application code is not enough sufficient, need the libOS as well.
Can we have a POSIX and Linux default set of LibOSes?
Debugging requires to understand the LibOS as well, which is bad...
\\

We can inject haven's solution for example with the set of guaranteed pages.
The application can put them into an enclave.
Find an attack scenario from corrupted host, and how we can prevent it.\\
