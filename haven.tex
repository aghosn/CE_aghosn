\section{Shielding Applications from an Untrusted Cloud with Haven}

Cloud computing service providers enable even small organizations to deploy web-based services quickly, with low start-up costs, and efficiently adapt the amount of available resources to their current load.
On a machine, the cloud service provider's host divides physical resources among co-located applications from different origins.
While attractive for their simplicity and adaptability, such services raise important confidentiality and integrity concerns that limit their adoption \cite{mining,NSAYahoo}.
Cloud services implement a unidirectional isolation model where privileged code (the host) is protected from the unprivileged one (the guest), and retains unrestricted access to the application's data.
In other words, Cloud users are forced to trust the entire Cloud privileged management software stack with their sensitive data and intellectual property.
As privacy and confidentiality are growing concerns, new techniques need to be devised to protect the application's data from a potentially compromised or malicious host.

Haven \cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BaumannPH15} is a system that leverages Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) \cite{SGXManual} to provide shielded execution of unmodified legacy applications on a commodity OS (Windows).
Shielded execution allows to protect the \emph{confidentiality} and \emph{integrity} of a program from the host (e.g., the OS) on which it runs.
Confidentiality ensures that the program's intermediate states are not observable by the rest of the system, while integrity guarantees that if the program completes, the output is correct.
We briefly introduce the Intel SGX extension main features before presenting Haven's design.

Haven leverages the low level isolation mechanisms provided by SGX to achieve shielded execution of legacy application binaries.
Since the host OS cannot be trusted, Haven provides most of the operating system services required by the application and manages policies and mechanisms for virtual resources, while the host retains management over physical ones.
This clear separation, coupled with defensive programming and careful interactions between guest and host, is supposed to facilitate Haven's resistance to so-called Iago attacks \cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/CheckowayS13}, i.e., a malicious host exploiting the application's trust to achieve its goals.

Haven's definition of shielded execution requires to
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item bootstrap and validate the execution environment within the enclave,
	\item implement virtual resource management within the enclave, and
	\item defend against a misbehaving host by verifying the result of every service requested from it%, and
	%\item prevent the host from gathering information on the enclave's state via exception handlers
\end{enumerate*}.
We now describe how Haven's design addresses each of these concerns.
Figure \ref{stackOfHaven} provides an overview of Haven's runtime stack.
The application, the LibOS, and the shield module form the trusted software base.
They are all encapsulated inside the enclave.

Haven wraps the application in a sandbox provided by Drawbridge \cite{DBLP:conf/asplos/PorterBHOH11}.
The application executes within a secured container, called \emph{picoprocess}, that exposes a narrow ABI to request OS services.
As a standard sandboxing mechanism, the picoprocess protects the host from the guest.

The application relies on a trusted library operating system (LibOS) to request system services.
In Haven, the LibOS is a modified version of Windows 8, retrofitted into a set of libraries, that implements the full OS API.
The LibOS is under user control and can be inspected and verified by the application.

In order to protect the application from Iago attacks, Haven relies on a \emph{shield module}.
The shield module exposes the drawbridge ABI to the LibOS and implements kernel functionalities and primitives such as memory management and thread synchronization.
It isolates the LibOS from a malicious host by validating all parameters and results that cross the border between trusted and untrusted parts of the runtime.
Such validations depend on the specific service required from the host OS, but mostly consist in sanity checks and observably consistent results.

The untrusted interface at the boundary of the enclave is designed to allow correctness verification by the shield, while being flexible enough to permit an efficient implementation of services on both sides.
The host manages physical resources while the guest handles virtual ones.

Underneath the untrusted interface, an untrusted runtime module forwards calls between the guest and the host.
This module also acts as a bootstrap to create the enclave and load the shield.

The host OS interacts with the enclave via the Drawbridge ABI and provides services relating to memory management, e.g., changing memory access rights or allocating untrusted virtual memory, thread signaling, access to external untrusted devices, e.g., storage, and to the system time.

Applications are deployed on the Cloud as encrypted disk images that contain both the application and the LibOS binaries.
The Cloud service provider is responsible for creating the picoprocess and loading the untrusted runtime, which in turns creates the enclave and loads the shield module.
SGX remote attestation mechanism is used to compute a quote of the shield and verify its integrity as well as the enclave's environment.
Afterwards, the shield generates asymmetric cryptography keys, securely sends its public key to a machine controlled by the user along with the quote.
The user verifies the shield's integrity, encrypts the disk image with the public key, and sends it to the shield.
The application is then ready to be loaded.

Haven stacks several software layers, each providing specific functionalities to the ones above it.
This layered architecture, coupled with the defensive programming design adopted, might introduce non-negligible overheads.
The next section focuses on Haven's reported performance.
